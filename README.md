# ASUS-Vivobook-S13-Hackintosh-EFI
# Hello, my name is Rysui or Instruct.
Ive been trying to hacktintosh my ASUS Vivobook S13 for a while now.
After qutting than coming back, ive finally found a solution!
Op-Core Simplify was giving me a kext that was making me kernel panic.
I found what kext it was and removed it then everything worked.
I wanted to share this efi with someone else just in case they are also getting the same error that I had.
